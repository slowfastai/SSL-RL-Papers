## 🌱 Motivation

Reading *Welcome to the Era of Experience* has been deeply inspiring. The essay crystallized a critical insight: methods like **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and **RLVR** (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards), while highly influential, are still rooted in **human-labeled data**. This situates them within the **Era of Human Data**, and broadly aligns them with **supervised learning paradigms**.

To build truly **general-purpose reinforcement learning (RL)** systems at scale, we must move beyond human-annotated signals and embrace the **Era of Experience** — where agents improve via continuous, autonomous interaction with the world.

In this context, I believe **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)** combined with **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** — particularly verifier-driven or value-based approaches — represents a promising and foundational direction. This repo curates key research at this intersection, aiming to accelerate the emergence of autonomous, self-improving agents that learn from experience.
